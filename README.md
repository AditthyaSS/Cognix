# 🧠 Cognix

### AI System Operator powered by Amazon Nova

> 🚧 **Project Status: Work in Progress**
> We are currently in the planning and requirement gathering phase.
> Implementation will begin shortly as we finalize system design, architecture, and feature scope.

## 🚀 Overview

Cognix is an AI-powered system operator that transforms how users interact with digital systems. Instead of manually performing repetitive tasks, users can rely on intelligent agents that understand, plan, and execute workflows autonomously.

By combining reasoning, voice interaction, and UI automation, Cognix acts as a **cognitive layer over your operating system and web applications**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User (Voice / Text)
        ↓
   Voice Processing (Nova Sonic)
        ↓
   Reasoning Engine (Nova Lite)

## ⚡ How It Works

1. User gives a command (voice or text)
2. Cognix understands intent using Nova models
3. Agents plan the execution steps
4. Automation engine performs actions
5. Results are returned in real-time
